A passionate and self-motivated web developer with a track record of academic excellence.
An investment banking research analyst with six years of experience developed detail-oriented skills and a team-oriented mentality.

The nature of an IB analyst involves a massive amount of online research, and it isn't hard for me to tell which websites are better built and well-designed. At a point in time, I realized the importance of website design and how the information should be presented and organized for visitors. And that's where my passion for web development comes from.

As a term 3 student in full-stack web development, I aim to build smooth, intuitive, and user-friendly web apps to help people achieve a better user experience and find what they need to achieve simultaneously.
