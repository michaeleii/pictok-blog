PicTok is a photo-sharing app tailored for the visually impaired. Our initial targets are fully blind and 80-90% visually impaired community. It allows users to take picture.  AI will recognize the picture and will output an audio based on the objects. The goal is to bridge a connection and fostering a sense of community for those who experience the world differently.
