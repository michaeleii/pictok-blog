PicTok is a photo-sharing app tailored for the visually impaired. Our initial targets are fully blind and 80-90% visually impaired users. Our goal is to generate a richer sensory experience for our users by merging voice descriptions of an image with background sounds, such as ocean waves, rustling leaves, birdsong, and etc. We aim to enable seamless photo exploration and sharing within the visually impaired community and potentially with sighted individuals.
