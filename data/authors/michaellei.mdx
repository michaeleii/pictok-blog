I am an ambitious and proactive person. I am always looking to challenge and improve my skills as a Full-Stack Web Developer. Currently, I am sharpening my skills at BCIT.

I started becoming interested in web development because I was drawn to attractive user interfaces and was eager to learn how I could create them. At the same time, my interest in computer building, sparked my curiosity about the intricate workings on the server side. This led me to pursue a career as a Full-Stack Web Developer, where I can blend both my passion for design with my desire to understand the technical intricacies of web development.

If you're interested in learning more about my skills as a web developer and how I can help you with your project, please don't hesitate to reach out and connect with me.
