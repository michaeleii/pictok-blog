## Logo

All members agreed upon a re-design for the logo and brand, so brainstorming began. The main problem with the logo was that the team wanted it to represent the 3 aspects of the Pic-tok app; visuals, sound and sharing. Unfortunately, to keep the logo simple, concise and attractive, it is best to design only around one or maybe two aspects. Including 3 would overwhelm and overcomplicate the logo, making it unusable in some cases.
In the end, the team decided on one main aspect to focus the design and style of the logo around, and that was sound. Since our app is designed around the visually impaired, the sense of sound is heightened. Although the main target market may have trouble seeing the logo, describe captioning and others can see the sound waves and earbuds and symbols of sound.

The design team continued their work on the figma with the layout, design and functionality of the high-fidelity version of the mock-up. Pages were added, moved around, and the prototyping was completed to give a ready-for-development version. Interactive prototyping was done, and creating animations for sending photos was important to make the app feel more app-like.
Each page section was slowly marked as ready for dev, letting the development team know it is ready to go for coding and development.

## Focus and Extras

The main focus for this week was the logo and the prototyping, although the design team is also working on another project for this app. The design team's other course big project is creating a video commercial for this app, so the process has begun for that as well.
The idea has been made for the commercial so storyboarding will begin very soon. The design team is excited as this will really put the main idea of the Pic-Tok app into something you can watch and feel for yourself, as words can only say so much, but video and sound can make you feel.
