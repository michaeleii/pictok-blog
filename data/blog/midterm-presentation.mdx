## After the Midterm Presentation

After presenting and demoing our application during the midterm evaluation week, it was then full force ahead. The demo went well, and we were faced with some thoughtful questions but were able to provide answers about how we were going to resolve those issues that were brought up and add some features suggested. Our presentation was professional and organized, which we were all proud of, but we know what to work on better for next time as well. We know that the final presentation at the end of the term is going to have more pressure and require just a little bit more overall, but we are excited.

## Usability Testing

The design team geared up to begin usability testing, and also worried about usability testing. PicTok is an app designed for visually impaired people, but as our user research has proven, coming into contact with visually impaired people is easier said than done.
The design team decided to use seeing people for usability testing anyway, just to test the basic function and flow of the app, then some select users would test the app users' built-in voice-over features of Apple and Android phones. There is a learning curve to voice-over, so any mistakes or confusion because of that feature will be overlooked and will solely focus on the app and its flow.

## Landing Page and Tutorial

The design team also worked on and designed a landing page for the app. Each member did one design, and then everyone agreed on one design to use and code out. Each page was customized to the target market and even a segment of that market with personalized keywords and phrases to boost SEO and engagement with users.
The tutorial will be a very quick 10-20 second animation video of how to use our app with gestures and how to send photos. There of course will be voice-over reading out and talking to the viewer, ideally a more realistic voice will be used so the viewer does not feel as if a robot is talking to them, but a person is.

## Extras

The design team is also hard at work on the video commercial, as well as merchandise including t-shirts, business cards and brochures.
Overall the app progress is going very well and we are all very pleased. We are looking forward to the final presentation and seeing what the final app can do.
