## Wrapping Up Loose Ends

With the big presentation day approaching fast, the design team and development team are hard at work perfecting the main feature and preparing the app for its big showcase. The app is ready to go essentially, with the main feature of the sound cues and voice cues reading out when a user uploads or takes a photo within the app, and being able to send it to friends on the app. The sounds work great, which is the main concern since our visually impaired users rely mostly on sound and feel, so use for them should be good.

## Usability Testing

Some final usability tests have been completed, and so far no major issues. The main issues are just nit-picking, specifically with the drop-down menu of the light/dark mode toggle switch and some design choices. Otherwise, the app has proven to do well in tests with sighted people, as we were unable to find visually impaired people, but it works well with the built-in voice-over feature on your iPhone/Android, so users who often use that feature should have little to no issues with navigation and usability.
Users who performed the usability tests have said the main feature is fun, and cool and can see the insight it could bring to the visually impaired community. In the end, the main goal is to make the visually impaired user feel connected and included with photo sharing like sighted people experience every day.

## Merchandise

The design team's final project is to create merchandise for the app, including business cards, brochures and t-shirts. The brochure and business cards have been designed and reviewed by an experienced teacher, who also gave some pointers on including braille in the design, which will be implemented using small vinyl sticker dots. The same idea with the braille sticker dots will be applied to the business cards, small raised dot stickers will spell out the PicTok name in braille.
The design team is also doing a little extra, with matching bucket hats, stickers to hand out to the audience, and matching t-shirts for the big presentation. The branding of t-shirts and stickers will help the audience remember the app for years to come.
